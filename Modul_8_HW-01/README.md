### Project description
Guess the hidden computer number using the minimum number of attempts.

:arrow_up:[to contents](README.md#Contents)


### What case are we solving?
You need to write a program that guess a number in a minimum number of attempts.

**Conditions of the competition:**
- The computer gives a number from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By “guess” we mean “write a program that guesses a number.”
- The observation algorithm provides information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.
- Number of attempts should not be bigger than 20.  

**Quality Metric**
The results are compared by the average value of the results over 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**
- Learning to write good code in *Python*
- Practice to work with *IDE*
- Practice to work with *GitHup*


### Data Brief
We are using code in file game_v3.py to find more effective algorithm.

- [x] Analyze exist algorithm
- [x] Try different approaches to improve it
- [x] By results choose the right solution
